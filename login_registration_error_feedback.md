**Title:**  
_As a user, I want to receive a message if I enter the wrong username or password, so that I know my login attempt was unsuccessful._

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
1. Incorrect credentials show a clear error message.  
2. Error does not reveal which part (username/password) was wrong.  
3. Retry is allowed.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Story Points:** 1  

**Notes:**  
- Message should be generic to prevent brute-force hints.
